Objects: They are similar to arrays but a collection of numbers, arrays, strings, another object. You have to access it by calling
the object name and then their property with either a dot or bracket in between. i.e.  Objects --> Objects.strings

Properties: They are located inside of an object, generally make up of numbers, arrays, strings, or even another object. Objects.strings <--Properties

Methods: located inside of a object as a function, can be called upon with a dot or brackets. 
i.e. const object = {methods: function(){random stuff}};

for in loop: a form of for loops generally used for objects.

Dot notation vs bracket notation: dot notation is for calling properties without spaces, bracket notation can be used for calling properties
with or without spaces.
